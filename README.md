Code used in Bellet et al. (link will be added here)

There is one jupyter notebook per main figure.

Supplementary analyses are contained in the supplementary notebooks.

Download the data on figshare (see the manuscript for the DOI) and edit the file path in the scripts accordingly.

First run the code in preprocessing.ipynb and then the figure scripts one after the other. Scripts in later notebooks are based on the output of previous notebooks.
